 * \class Zeni::Sound_Source_Pool
 *
 * \ingroup zenilib
 *
 * \brief This class manages Sound_Sources.
 *
 * This class assigns Sound_Source_HW to 'Sound_Source's on update.
 *
 * This avoids the problem of users generating more 'Sound_Source's than
 * the hardware on a given computer actually supports.
