NullSet and me (m4tr1x) are on storyline.
The new ideas alway pop up and so we should be making a note of it for further discussion purpose.

Lets start putting our idea here

* Trainers idea (m4tr1x) - A triner should be given at start of the game where you can start playing the game without caring about reaching the next level.It should have a test pages about all challeneges a user might face during the game.It will help any player to prepare himself for the real game
