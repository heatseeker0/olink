Trainer Mode 

ohk after thinking about it for many times i came up with the fact that many begineers are gonna play this game and when they will start playing then they will have to go ahead without even having idea whats to come up.Even if it might come as surprise to them but when you are stuck up at the level and dont know how to go ahead you simply quit because dor bordom, so its better to have a triner mode at begining of game so people will be able to play and learn there without worrying about getting to next level. 

i would like to hear about it from all the members.Please put up your ideas thanks
