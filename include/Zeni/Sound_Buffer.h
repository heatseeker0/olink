 *
 * \brief Stores Sound Data
 *
 * A Sound_Buffer stores sound data to be played from Sound_Sources.
 *
 * \note Mono sounds work best.
 *
 * \warning Stereo sounds will not be affected by the positional audio system.  Furthermore, in a surround sound speaker setup, they may play only through the left and right channels.
