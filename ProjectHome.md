OLink & 0Link are the same thing.  OLink stands for OpenLink, or Open-Uplink.  0Link is a name which I (bluechill) have come to like as the name for an open source, from scratch, version of Uplink.  OLink/0Link can be pronounced in three different ways, O-Link, Open-Link, and Zero-Link.  But what is Uplink?  Uplink is a Hollywood-esque style hacking simulation.  OLink aims to be better, not a Hollywood-esque style simulation but more realistic.  OLink is made by hackers for hackers (and consumers who like more realistic hacking games).
