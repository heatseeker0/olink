What is OLink? OLink is a realistic simulation.  It is a hacking simulation where everything from binary editing (Reverse Engineering) to SQL injection can be performed.  However, before we go into more details, you must understand why we made OLink and where the idea for OLink came to be.  That is from a project called Uplink.

# Uplink #

Uplink is a game made by Introversion.  To quote from their website:

> Uplink is a simulated hacking tool, which allows you to perform various acts of high-tech computer crime.
> You can steal computer files, compromise government computer systems etc etc. You make money by
> hiring out your skills as a freelance hacker.

# OLink (Pre 2011) #

Originally OLink stood for Open-Link or just OLink and was supposed to be a clone of Uplink.  Uplink had a huge number of flaws in it and so OLink's goal was originally similar to [Onlink's](http://www.onlink-mod.net/).  That goal was to build a better version of Uplink which would be more sane (ie. not everyone is a company) and to be more complete overall.  However, as time went on the idea seemed something which wouldn't be that fun to the programmers.

# OLink (Post & During 2011) #

During the summer of 2011 the idea evolved from being just some Uplink clone to be something better.  OLink became what we know today, a hacking simulator.  A tool for teaching security.  The idea now is to build a hacking simulator which is extremely realistic.

OLink will be not be a clone of Uplink.  It will be an extremely realistic security simulation.  Some of the types of exploits OLink will include are;

  * RE (Reverse Engineering)
    * Binary Editing
    * Application Cracking
  * SQL Injection
  * And many more

OLink will feature an immersive open world where you can buy, create, sell, & use programs and then also hack into servers.  The servers are simulated however.

OLink plans to be much more than just what Uplink was, or even [Onlink](http://www.onlink-mod.net/).  OLink plans to also be not a hollywood hacking simulator, but rather, a realistic hacking simulator.
