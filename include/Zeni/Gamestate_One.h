* \brief 3D Game Development Framework
*
* This library acts as as frontend to SDL (Simple Directmedia Layer), 
* OpenGL, and Direct3D 9.  It also uses SDL_image, SDL_mixer, SDL_ttf, 
* and lib3ds, among other libraries.  It has successfully been compiled 
* using Microsoft Visual Studio, XCode, and GCC.
*
* All built-in rendering functionality is supported in both OpenGL and 
* Direct3D 9.

* \ingroup zenilib
*
* \brief Initial Gamestate
*
* This class is close to having the simplest definition possible for a 
* Gamestate in zenilib.  It is to be used similarly to a main function, 
* in that it should exist only as a launching pad to more meaningful 
* Gamestates.
*
* \note It is not necessary to change the definition of this class to use it for its intended purpose.
